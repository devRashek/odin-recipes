    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h4>Francesinha refers to a sandwich that is served on a plate. The recipe uses thick slices of white loaf bread with ham (Portuguese Fiambre), sausage, cheese, and steak. The sandwich is then topped with more cheese, usually taken to the oven to melt, and lastly, a slightly spicy sauce on top.</h4>
