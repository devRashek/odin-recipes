    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h4>Spaghetti bolognese consists of spaghetti (long strings of pasta) with an Italian ragù (meat sauce) made with minced beef, bacon and tomatoes, served with Parmesan cheese. Spaghetti bolognese is one of the most popular pasta dishes eaten outside of Italy.</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Beef Mince</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Carrot</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Stock</li>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To start, cook ground beef with olive oil, salt and pepper. Then add onions and garlic. I used my frozen garlic that I prepped, but if you have time, fresh garlic is always great.</li>
        <li>Next, add Italian seasoning, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste and some pasta water and mix everything together. You’ll notice the sauce looks done and ready to be served at this point. But it’s very important to let it simmer for at least 30 minutes. That’s how this bolognese sauce gets that deep and rich flavor.</li>
        <li>After you’ve been patient long enough, you’ll notice that the sauce thickens. Now you can throw on some fresh herbs to finish it off. I like using a mix of fresh basil and flat leaf parsley if you have them. And that’s basically the bolognese sauce ready to top your favorite pasta.</li>
        <li>Congratulations, done!</li>
    </ol>
